# ACTUAL BENCHMARK RESULTS - NO BULLSHIT

## Raw Data

### Before (June 3, 2025)
- NFP Write: 237,099 ops/s
- JDK Write: 1,762,356 ops/s  
- NFP Tree: 4,919 ops/s
- JDK Tree: 21,808 ops/s

### After (June 9, 2025)
- NFP Write: 235,124 ops/s
- JDK Write: 1,894,582 ops/s
- NFP Tree: 4,812 ops/s
- JDK Tree: 24,231 ops/s

## The Fucking Truth

### Write Performance
- **NFP got WORSE**: 237,099 → 235,124 ops/s (-0.8%)
- **JDK got BETTER**: 1,762,356 → 1,894,582 ops/s (+7.5%)
- **Gap WIDENED**: Was 7.4x slower, now 8.1x slower

### Tree Performance  
- **NFP got WORSE**: 4,919 → 4,812 ops/s (-2.2%)
- **JDK got BETTER**: 21,808 → 24,231 ops/s (+11.1%)
- **Gap WIDENED**: Was 4.4x slower, now 5.0x slower

## What Actually Happened

After days of refactoring:
1. **ZERO performance improvement** - NFP is actually slightly slower
2. **Performance gap got WORSE** - from 7.4x to 8.1x on writes
3. **Tree performance degraded further** - from 4.4x to 5.0x slower

## The Numbers Don't Lie

**NFP Write Speed**: 
- Expected after removing HashMap lookups: ~1.5M ops/s
- Actual: 235K ops/s
- **Still 8x slower than JDK**

**NFP Tree Speed**:
- Expected improvement: 2x-3x  
- Actual: -2.2% (got worse)
- **Still 5x slower than JDK**

## Conclusion

The refactoring fixed bugs but delivered **ZERO** performance improvement. The HashMap removal either:
1. Didn't actually happen on the hot path
2. Was replaced by something equally slow
3. Wasn't the real bottleneck

The performance is still catastrophically bad compared to JDK serialization.
