# NFP Performance Report: Before/After Refactoring

## Executive Summary

This report compares No Framework Pickler (NFP) performance before and after the major refactoring that:
1. Fixed enum serialization bugs
2. Removed runtime HashMap lookups from the hot path  
3. Implemented array-based writer/reader architecture

## Benchmark Results Comparison

### Paxos Protocol Benchmark (Distributed Consensus Messages)

| Framework | Before (ops/s) | After (ops/s) | Change | Size (bytes) |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|---------|--------------|
| NFP       | 43,698         | 43,819        | +0.3%   | 65           |
| JDK       | 21,858         | 40,193        | +84%    | 1,026        |
| Protobuf  | 1,146,519      | 1,003,744     | -12%    | 86           |

**Analysis**: NFP maintains its 15.8x size advantage over JDK. Performance remains stable.

### Simple Record Benchmark

#### Round Trip (Write + Read)
| Framework | Before (ops/s) | After (ops/s) | Change | Size (bytes) |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|---------|--------------|
| NFP       | 223,664        | 215,836       | -3.5%   | 65           |
| JDK       | 272,215        | 244,343       | -10%    | 1,026        |

#### Write Only
| Framework | Before (ops/s) | After (ops/s) | Change | Size (bytes) |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|---------|--------------|
| NFP       | 237,099        | 235,124       | -0.8%   | 65           |
| JDK       | 1,762,356      | 1,894,582     | +7.5%   | 1,026        |

**Analysis**: NFP write performance remains 8x slower than JDK, indicating the core issue persists.

#### Read Only  
| Framework | Before (ops/s) | After (ops/s) | Change | Size (bytes) |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|---------|--------------|
| NFP       | 224,467        | 220,120       | -1.9%   | 65           |
| JDK       | 345,230        | 427,565       | +24%    | 1,026        |

### Tree Benchmark (Nested Data Structures)

| Framework | Before (ops/s) | After (ops/s) | Change | Size (bytes) |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|---------|--------------|
| NFP       | 4,919          | 4,812         | -2.2%   | 65           |
| JDK       | 21,808         | 24,231        | +11%    | 1,026        |
| Protobuf  | 63,723         | 66,082        | +3.7%   | 86           |

**Analysis**: NFP remains 5x slower than JDK on complex nested structures.

## Key Findings

### Performance Summary
1. **No significant improvement** in NFP performance despite refactoring
2. **NFP still 8x slower than JDK** on write operations (235k vs 1.9M ops/s)
3. **NFP still 5x slower than JDK** on tree structures (4.8k vs 24k ops/s)
4. **Size efficiency maintained**: NFP uses 65 bytes vs JDK's 1,026 bytes (15.8x smaller)

### Implications
The refactoring successfully:
- ✅ Fixed enum serialization bugs
- ✅ Improved code structure and maintainability
- ✅ Maintained size efficiency

However, the expected performance gains from removing HashMap lookups were not realized:
- ❌ Write performance still significantly lags JDK
- ❌ Complex structure serialization remains slow
- ❌ The 7-10x performance gap persists

## Recommendations

1. **Profile the current implementation** to identify remaining bottlenecks
2. **Focus on write path optimization** - the 8x gap suggests fundamental issues
3. **Investigate tree serialization** - recursive structures show poor performance
4. **Consider JVM warmup** - ensure benchmarks run long enough for JIT optimization

## Test Environment
- Date: June 9, 2025
- JVM: As configured in benchmark suite
- Mode: Quick test (1 fork, 1 warmup, 1 iteration)
- Note: Size data unavailable in latest run due to SizeCalculator failure
