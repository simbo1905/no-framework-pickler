# No Framework Pickler

No Framework Pickler is a tiny serialization library that generates elegant, fast, type-safe serializers for Java
records and sealed interface hierarchies of records â€” perfect for building elegant message protocols using modern Data
Oriented Programming techniques:

```java
/// Given a sealed interface and its permitted record types using Java's new Data Oriented Programming paradigm:
public sealed interface TreeNode permits TreeNode.InternalNode, TreeNode.LeafNode, TreeNode.TreeEnum {
  record LeafNode(int value) implements TreeNode {
  }

  record InternalNode(String name, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) implements TreeNode {
  }

  enum TreeEnum implements TreeNode {EMPTY}

  static TreeNode empty() {
    return TreeEnum.EMPTY;
  }

  /// Sealed interfaces allow for exhaustively pattern matched within switch expressions
  static boolean areTreesEqual(TreeNode l, TreeNode r) {
    return switch (l) {
      case TreeEnum.EMPTY -> r == TreeEnum.EMPTY;
      case LeafNode(var v1) -> r instanceof LeafNode(var v2) && v1 == v2;
      case InternalNode(String n1, TreeNode i1, TreeNode i2) ->
          r instanceof InternalNode(String n2, TreeNode j1, TreeNode j2) &&
              n1.equals(n2) &&
              areTreesEqual(i1, j1) &&
              areTreesEqual(i2, j2);
    };
  }
}

// ByteBuffer for high performance serialization 
ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);

// Given a tree of nodes:
final var rootNode = new TreeNode.InternalNode("Root",
    new TreeNode.InternalNode("Branch1", new TreeNode.LeafNode(42), new TreeNode.LeafNode(99)),
    new TreeNode.InternalNode("Branch2", new TreeNode.LeafNode(123), TreeNode.empty()));

// And a type safe pickler for the sealed interface:
Pickler<TreeNode> treeNodePickler = Pickler.forClass(TreeNode.class);

// When we serialize a tree of nodes to a ByteBuffer and load it back out again:
treeNodePickler.

serialize(buffer, rootNode);
buffer.

flip();

TreeNode deserializedRoot = treeNodePickler.deserialize(buffer);

// Then it has elegantly and safely reconstructed the entire tree structure
if(TreeNode.

areTreesEqual(rootNode, deserializedRoot) ){
    System.out.

println("The trees are equal!");
}
```

**No Framework Pickler is Java** where in a single line of code creates a typesafe pickler for a sealed interface
hierarchy of records. There are no annotations. There are no build-time steps. There are n generated data structures you
need to map to your regular code. There is no special configuration files. There is no manual just Java. You get all the
convenience that the built-in JDK serialization with none of the downsides.

**No Framework Pickler is fast** as it avoids reflection on the hot path by using the JDK's `unreflect` on the resolved
constructors and component accessors of the Java records. This work is one once when the type-safe pickler is
constructed. The
cached [Direct Method Handles](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/invoke/MethodHandleInfo.html#directmh)
then do the actual work. On some workloads it can be 2x faster than standard Java serialization while creating a binary
payload that is 0.5x the size.

**No Framework Pickler is compact** as the entire codebase is in one Java source file with 1,300 lines of code not
counting the extensive comments. It creates a single Jar file with no dependencies that is around 36k in size. It has no
dependencies.

**No Framework Pickler is safer** than many alternative approaches. The pickler resolves the legal code paths that
regular Java code would take when creating the pickler; not when it is reading binary data. Bad data on the wire will
never result in mal-constructed data structures with undefined behaviour.

**No Framework Pickler is expressive** as it works out of the box with nested sealed interfaces of permitted record
types or an outer array of such where the records may contain arbitrarily nested:

- boolean.class
- byte.class
- short.class
- char.class
- int.class
- long.class
- float.class
- double.class
- String.class
- Optional.class
- Record.class
- Map.class
- List.class
- Enum.class
- Arrays of the above

When handling sealed interfaces it is requires all permitted subclasses within the sealed hierarchy must be either
records or sealed interfaces of records. This allows you to use record patterns with type safe exhaustive switch
statements.

**No Framework Pickler backwards compatibility** supports opt-in binary compatibility for adding new components to the
end of your `record` types. You simply provide alternative constructors in your newer code to match the default
constructor of your old code. This is disabled by default.

## Usage

No Framework Pickler enforces that the root type passed to `Pickler.forClass()` must be either:

- A `record` type
- A `sealed interface` that permits mixtures of `record` or `enum` types
- A `sealed interface` that permits mixtures of `record` or `enum` types or nested `sealed interface` of `record` or
  `enum` types to any level

See the Complex Nested Sealed Interfaces example below and also the demo files `PublicApiDemo.java` and
`TreeNodeSealedInterfacePicklerTest.java`.

Java Data Oriented Programming allows for strongly typed and exhaustive switch statements to work with
`sealed interface` types. As library code, No Framework Pickler has no direct access to the complex types and it avoids
reflection on the hot path. This precludes passing outer container types (arrays, List or Map) to the pickler. In
practice this is not a significant limitation as users of the library that have a List, Map or array of a complex sealed
type can simply manually write out the length/size then loop invoking the pickler. To read back, they can manually read
the length/size then loop with an exhaustive switch to handle the concrete types as they wish. See the demo file
`PublicApiDemo.java` for an example.

### Basic Record Serialization

Here the optional `maxSizeOf` will recursively walk any large nested structures or arrays to calculate the exact size of
the buffer needed to hold the serialized data:

```java
/// Define a record using the enum. It **must** be public
public record Month(Season season, String name) {
}

/// Define a simple enum with no fields so no custom constructor. It **must** be public
public enum Season {SPRING, SUMMER, FALL, WINTER}

// Create an instance
var december = new Month(Season.WINTER, "December");

// Get a pickler for the record type containing the enum
Pickler<Month> pickler = Pickler.forClass(Month.class);

// Calculate size and allocate buffer
int size = pickler.maxSizeOf(december);
ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(size);

// Serialize to a ByteBuffer
pickler.

serialize(buffer, december);
buffer.

flip();

// Deserialize from the ByteBuffer
Month deserializedMonth = pickler.deserialize(buffer);

// Verify the deserialized enum value
if(!deserializedMonth.

equals(december)){
    throw new

AssertionError("should not be reached");
}
```

### Nested Record Tree

```java
import io.github.simbo1905.no.framework.Pickler;

/// The sealed interface and all permitted record subclasses must be public.
/// The records can be static inner classes or top level classes.
/// Nested sealed interfaces are supported see the Animal example below.
public sealed interface TreeNode permits InternalNode, LeafNode, TreeEnum {
  static TreeNode empty() {
    return TreeEnum.EMPTY;
  }
}

public record InternalNode(String name, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) implements TreeNode {
}

public record LeafNode(int value) implements TreeNode {
}

public enum TreeEnum implements TreeNode {
  EMPTY
}

final var leaf1 = new LeafNode(42);
final var leaf2 = new LeafNode(99);
final var leaf3 = new LeafNode(123);
final var internal1 = new InternalNode("Branch1", leaf1, leaf2);
final var internal2 = new InternalNode("Branch2", leaf3, TreeNode.empty());
final var originalRoot = new InternalNode("Root", internal1, internal2);

// Get a pickler for the TreeNode sealed interface
final var pickler = Pickler.forClass(TreeNode.class);

// Calculate buffer size needed for the whole graph reachable from the root node
final var bufferSize = pickler.maxSizeOf(originalRoot);

// Allocate a buffer to hold the entire tree
final var buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(bufferSize);

// Serialize the root node (which includes the entire graph)
pickler.

serialize(buffer, originalRoot);

// Prepare buffer for reading
buffer.

flip();

// Deserialize the root node (which will reconstruct the entire graph depth first)
final var deserializedRoot = pickler.deserialize(buffer);

// Validates the entire tree structure was properly deserialized
assertTrue(TreeNode.areTreesEqual(originalRoot, deserializedRoot), "Tree structure validation failed");
```

### Returned List Components And Map Components Are Immutable

All deserialized list inside of Records are immutable:

```java
// Create a record with nested lists
record NestedListRecord(List<List<String>> nestedList) {
}

// Make the inner lists.
List<List<String>> nestedList = new ArrayList<>();
nestedList.

add(Arrays.asList("A", "B","C"));
    nestedList.

add(Arrays.asList("D", "E"));

// The record has mutable inner lists
NestedListRecord original = new NestedListRecord(nestedList);

// Get a pickler for the record
Pickler<NestedListRecord> pickler = Pickler.forClass(NestedListRecord.class);

// Calculate size and allocate buffer
int size = pickler.maxSizeOf(original);
ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(size);

// Serialize
pickler.

serialize(buffer, original);
buffer.

flip();

// Deserialize
NestedListRecord deserialized = pickler.deserialize(buffer);

// The returned inner lists are immutable
assertThrows(UnsupportedOperationException .class, () ->deserialized.

nestedList().

removeFirst());
```

Maps within records are also returned as immutable:

```java

public record NestedFamilyMapContainer(Person subject, Map<String, Person> relationships) {
}

Person john = new Person("John", 40);
Person michael = new Person("Michael", 65);
Person sarah = new Person("Sarah", 63);

Map<String, Person> familyMap = new HashMap<>();
familyMap.

put("father",michael);
familyMap.

put("mother",sarah);

final var original = new NestedFamilyMapContainer(john, familyMap);

// Get a pickler for the record
final var pickler = Pickler.forClass(NestedFamilyMapContainer.class);
// Calculate size and allocate buffer
int size = pickler.maxSizeOf(original);
ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(size);
// Serialize
pickler.

serialize(buffer, original);
// Prepare buffer for reading
buffer.

flip();

// Deserialize
NestedFamilyMapContainer deserialized = pickler.deserialize(buffer);

// The returned inner map are immutable
assertThrows(UnsupportedOperationException .class, () ->deserialized.

relationships().

put("brother",new Person("Tom", 35)));
```

### Complex Nested Sealed Interfaces

This example shows how to serialize and deserialize a heterogeneous array of records that implement a sealed interface.
The records are nested within the sealed interface hierarchy, and the serialization process handles the complexity of
the nested data structures:

```java
// Protocol
sealed interface Animal permits Mammal, Bird, Alicorn {
}

sealed interface Mammal extends Animal permits Dog, Cat {
}

sealed interface Bird extends Animal permits Eagle, Penguin {
}

public record Alicorn(String name, String[] magicPowers) implements Animal {
}

public record Dog(String name, int age) implements Mammal {
}

public record Cat(String name, boolean purrs) implements Mammal {
}

public record Eagle(double wingspan) implements Bird {
}

record Penguin(boolean canSwim) implements Bird {
}

// Create instances of all animal types
static Dog dog = new Dog("Buddy", 3);
static Dog dog2 = new Dog("Fido", 2);
static Animal eagle = new Eagle(2.1);
static Penguin penguin = new Penguin(true);
static Alicorn alicorn = new Alicorn("Twilight Sparkle", new String[]{"elements of harmony", "wings of a pegasus"});

static List<Animal> animals = List.of(dog, dog2, eagle, penguin, alicorn);
Pickler<Animal> pickler = Pickler.forClass(Animal.class);
final var buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);

// anyone reading back needs to know how many records to read back
buffer.

putInt(animals.size());

    for(
Animal animal :animals){
    pickler.

serialize(buffer, animal);
}

    buffer.

flip(); // Prepare for reading

// any service reading back needs to know how many records to read back
int size = buffer.getInt();

// Deserialize the correct number of records
List<Animal> deserializedAnimals = new ArrayList<>(size);
IntStream.

range(0,size).

forEach(i ->{
Animal animal = pickler.deserialize(buffer);
    deserializedAnimals.

add(animal);
});
```

### Serialization And Deserialization Of Multiple Records

When serializing multiple records, you need to manually track the count:

```java
// Create a pickler for your type
Pickler<Person> pickler = Pickler.forClass(Person.class);
List<Person> people = List.of(
    new Person("Alice", 30),
    new Person("Bob", 25),
    new Person("Charlie", 40)
);

ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);

// Write the count first
buffer.

putInt(people.size());

// Serialize each person
    for(
Person person :people){
    pickler.

serialize(buffer, person);
}

    buffer.

flip(); // Prepare for reading

// Read the count
int count = buffer.getInt();

// Deserialize each person
List<Person> deserializedPeople = new ArrayList<>(count);
for(
int i = 0;
i<count;i++){
    deserializedPeople.

add(pickler.deserialize(buffer));
    }

// Verify the deserialization
assertEquals(people.size(),deserializedPeople.

size());
    for(
int i = 0; i <people.

size();

i++){

assertEquals(people.get(i),deserializedPeople.

get(i));
    }
```

## Security

This library is secure by default by:

1. When you create a Pickler instance the `unreflect` method is used to
   make [Direct Method Handles](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/invoke/MethodHandleInfo.html#directmh)
   for the constructor(s) and component accessors
2. Using the JDK's `ByteBuffer` class to read and write binary data ensures that the bytes are validate by the JDK.
3. Strings are explicitly using UTF8 bytes that are validated by the ByteArray `readUtf8` method.
4. The pickler resolves what are the legal permitted class names of all records within a sealed interface hierarchy at
   when you create the pickler; not when you are deserializing.
5. There is logic for backwards and forwards compatibility of `records`. This is disabled by default so you must
   explicitly enable it.
6. Java has specifically created `record` types to model data transfer objects safely. The backwards and forwards
   compatibility logic matches deserialization components to constructors. The JDK ensures that the canonical
   constructor is always called so that `record` types are always properly initialized.
7. The JDK ensures that nested `record` types can only be constructed bottom-up. This ensures that the deserialization
   logic behaves like normal Java code with no reflection tricks.
8. When `MethodHandle`s are invoked they validate the types and numbers of parameters are correct.

If you instantiate a pickler for a `sealed interface` it ensures that the permitted types of the sealed interface are
all `record` types else nested `sealed interface`s of records. It then builds a map of the validated classNames to the
correct classes. When it reads back the class type strings this is via the `ByteBuffer` method `readUtf8`. It then
checks that string against the map of permitted class names to classes. It then delegates to the pickler for the
concrete record.

## Schema Evolution

No Framework Pickler provides **opt-in** backwards compatibility that is more restrictive than JDK serialization because
we don't write component names to the wire. This keeps the wire format compact but requires careful schema evolution.

### Security by Default

Each record type has an 8-byte signature computed from:

- The record's simple class name
- Each component's name and generic return type signature

For example, `record MyThing(List<Optional<Double>>[] compA)` generates a SHA-256 hash of:

```
MyThing!ARRAY!LIST!OPTIONAL!Double!compA
```

In the default `DISABLED` mode, any schema change (reordering, renaming, type changes) causes deserialization to fail
fast with `InvalidClassException`, preventing silent data corruption. This mimics JDK serialization behavior and may
indicate either a developer error or a deliberate targeted attack.

**Security Note**: It is always wise to add encryption-level message confidentiality and message integrity security to
prevent against any form of tampering attack, which is beyond the scope of this documentation.

### Backward Compatibility Modes

## TL;DR

- **DISABLED**: Default mode. Strictly no backwards compatibility. Fails fast on any schema mismatch.
- **DEFAULTED**: Opt-in mode. Emulates JDK serialization functionality with a risky corner case.
- If you do opt-in **never** reorder existing fields or enum constants in your source file to avoid the risky corner
  case of "swapping" components or enum constants when deserializing.

To opt-in set the system property `no.framework.Pickler.Compatibility`:

```shell
-Dno.framework.Pickler.Compatibility=DISABLED|DEFAULTED
```

## Compatibility Modes Explained

With No Framework Pickler your java code is the "schema" of your data structures. You can evolve your records and enums
in a way that is safe only by adding new values to the end of the record or enum definitions. This is because we do not
write out field names or enum constant names to the wire.

The two gotcha are only if you opt in to the `DEFAULTED` mode:

- If you serialize to storage when your code was `record Point(int x, int y)`, then later read it back with
  `record Point(int y, int x)`, there is an undetectable "swapping" of data.
- If you serialize to storage when your code was `enum Status{GOOD,BAD}`, then later read it back with
  `enum Status{GOOD,BAD}`, there is an undetectable "swapping" of constants.

More sophisticated picklers like Protocol Buffers, Apache Avro, and others use external schema-like files. Those require
users to read the manual to understand how to get started. That upfront effort and ongoing complexity gives them more
options to explicitly handle schema evolution. They also allow for fail fast modes on wire format changes. JDK
Serialization as the concept of serialVersionUID mechanism handle schema evolution. We all know how that worked out in
practice.

No Framework Pickler is designed:

- simple and easy to use.
- compact and fast
- safe by default

This requires us to use cryptographic hashes to detect schema changes and forbid them by default to be safe by default.

### Example: Adding a Field to a Record

**Original Record (V1):**

```java
package io.github.simbo1905.no.framework.evolution;

public record SimpleRecord(int value) {
}
```

**Evolved Record (V2) - Safe Evolution:**

```java
package io.github.simbo1905.no.framework.evolution;

// Only works with: -Dno.framework.Pickler.Compatibility=DEFAULTED
public record SimpleRecord(int value, String name, double score) {
  // Backward compatibility constructor for original schema
  public SimpleRecord(int value) {
    this(value, "default", 0.0);
  }
}
```

When deserializing V1 data with V2 code in `DEFAULTED` mode:

- `value` retains its serialized value (42)
- `name` and `score` use the compatibility constructor's defaults ("default" and 0.0)

**Dangerous Evolution - Never Do This:**

```java
// WRONG: Reordering fields causes silent data corruption!
public record UserInfo(int accessLevel, String name, String department) {
  // This will swap name and accessLevel values!
}
```

### Limitations

- Adding new permitted types to sealed interfaces is not supported in compatibility mode
- The old codebase cannot deserialize new record types it doesn't know about
- You must implement your own routing logic to prevent sending new types to old services

There are unit tests that dynamically compile and class load different versions of records to explicitly test both
backwards and forwards compatibility across three generations. See `SchemaEvolutionTest.java` and
`BackwardsCompatibilityTest.java` for examples of how to write your own tests.

# Wire Protocol

The wire protocol uses ZigZag-encoded markers for types:

### Built-in Type Markers

Built-in types use negative markers based on their position in the Constants enum:

| Type           | Wire Marker | Description                                |
|----------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| NULL           | 0           | Null value (safe for uninitialized memory) |
| BOOLEAN        | -1          | Boolean value                              |
| BYTE           | -2          | Single byte                                |
| SHORT          | -3          | Short integer                              |
| CHARACTER      | -4          | Character                                  |
| INTEGER        | -5          | Integer (fixed encoding)                   |
| INTEGER_VAR    | -6          | Integer (varint encoding)                  |
| LONG           | -7          | Long (fixed encoding)                      |
| LONG_VAR       | -8          | Long (varint encoding)                     |
| FLOAT          | -9          | Float                                      |
| DOUBLE         | -10         | Double                                     |
| STRING         | -11         | UTF-8 encoded string                       |
| OPTIONAL_EMPTY | -12         | Empty Optional                             |
| OPTIONAL_OF    | -13         | Optional with value                        |
| ENUM           | -14         | Enum value                                 |
| ARRAY          | -15         | Array                                      |
| MAP            | -16         | Map                                        |
| LIST           | -17         | List                                       |
| RECORD         | -18         | Record                                     |
| UUID           | -19         | UUID                                       |

### User Type Markers

User-defined types (Records and Enums) use positive markers:

- Discovered types are sorted lexicographically by class name
- Wire marker = array index + 1 (1-indexed to avoid 0)
- This enables compact single-byte encoding for the first 127 user types

The wire protocol is explained in this diagram:

## Why Did Your Write This Framework Killer Code As A Single Java File?

No Framework Pickler came about because I was doing Java Data Oriented programming over sealed traits using Java 21. I
wanted to quickly transmit them as a simple message protocol. Including large framework for something so basic seemed
like a world of future security issues and forced upgrades. Doing something quick and simple in a single Java file felt
right. I wanted to avoid reflection and found out:

- The Java `record` types is specifically designed to be a safe data transfer object.
- The JDK's `ByteBuffer` class correctly validates UTF8 bytes for Strings and safely handles all primitive types.
- The JDK's `MethodHandle` class lets you `unreflect` them to get lower
  overhead [Direct Method Handles](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/invoke/MethodHandleInfo.html#directmh)
- Nested `sealed interfaces` that only contain `records` can be exhaustively matched switch statements to deconstruct
  the records are exactly what you need to model message protocol on Java 21+.

When I looked at just adding a bit more it all seemed easy enough. Until now the challenge with using record patterns in
switch statements for a pure data exchange protocols are:

- The built-in Java Serialization mechanism is university loathed. Even if was magically fixed in future Java versions
  no-one will ever trust it
- Drop in replacements for java serialization like [Apache Fury](https://github.com/apache/fury/tree/main/java) at the
  time of writing only (v0.10.1) under `fure-core/src/main/java` has 229 java source files and 56,000 lines of code. The
  `fury-core-0.10.1.jar` Jar file is 1.9M in size.
- The historic way to deal with things is to use a "standard" protocol like JDK Serialization, Protocol Buffers, Apache
  Avro, JSON, Hessian, Flatbuffers,, Thrift (TBinaryProtocol, TCompactProtocol, TJSONProtocol), MessagePack, XML, etc.
- Picking any of those makes you have to learn and deal with the complexities and security vulnerabilities of libraries
  such as Kryo, Fst, Protostuff, Jsonb, Protobuf, Flatbuffers, Jackson, Thrift, Fury (when it is stable), FastJSON,
  JBoss Serialization, etc

That amount of choice is overwhelming. You are spoilt for choices you become a prisoner of then. The answer to avoid all
this complexity is to leverage the modern JDK. We can then potentially free thousands of teams from thousands of hours
of build time with a "no framework pickler" solution that replaces entire frameworks in a single Java file.

## Implementation Note: Recursive Meta-programming

No Framework Pickler achieves its support for arbitrarily nested container types through a recursive metaprogramming
pattern implemented at construction time. This pattern enables serialization of deeply nested structures like
`List<Map<String, Optional<Integer[]>[]>>` without any special-case code.

The core pattern is: `(ARRAY|LIST|MAP)* -> (ENUM|RECORD|DOUBLE|INTEGER|...)`

When you create a pickler, it performs static analysis on your types using `TypeStructure.analyze()`, which recursively
unwraps:

- Generic types (List<T>, Map<K,V>, Optional<T>)
- Array types (T[], T[][], etc.)
- Raw types to their component types

This analysis produces a chain of container types ending in a leaf type. The metaprogramming then walks this chain from
right-to-left (leaf back through containers), building delegation chains where each container handler knows how to:

1. Serialize/deserialize its own structure (e.g., array length, map size)
2. Delegate to its component type's handler for each element

For example, given `List<List<Double[]>>`, the system builds:

- A DOUBLE writer that knows how to write individual doubles
- An ARRAY writer that writes array metadata then delegates to the DOUBLE writer for each element
- A LIST writer that writes list size then delegates to the ARRAY writer for each element
- An outer LIST writer that delegates to the inner LIST writer

This delegation chain is built once at construction time using the `buildWriterChain()`, `buildReaderChain()`, and
`buildSizerChain()` methods. At runtime, there's zero type inspection - just direct method handle invocations through
the pre-built chain.

The beauty of this approach is that it automatically handles any nesting depth and any combination of container types.
Whether you have `Optional<Map<String, List<Integer[]>[]>>` or `List<List<List<List<String>>>>`, the same recursive
pattern builds the appropriate delegation chain without any special cases in the code.

## Logging

You can enable logging using the java.util.logging framework. There are bridges available for the main logging
frameworks
such as for SLF4J and Log4j2. The pickler tests uses the `java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler` to log messages at `INFO`,
`FINE`, `FINER` and `FINEST` level. You can enable this by setting the system property
`java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level`. You can run the unit tests with the levels to see the output:

```shell
mvn test -Dtest=RefactorTests,MachinaryTests -Djava.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level=FINER
```
